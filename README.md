# Health-Survey-Data-Analysis
For this analysis we are using state health departments survey responses collected for a yearly evaluation by the CDC.
Here are are going to evaluate the data for any correlations between physical health (PHYSHLTH) and home ownership (RENTHOM1).
## The Data

Our data source is CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm.
It is a yearly telephone survey that is an accumulation of surveys taken by each state, Washington, DC and the US territories. Participants are questioned to evaluate possibly risky and preventative behaviors in regards to their own health factors. Each state completes at least 4,000 interview, per month, per year. Questions can be the same and or uniquely relevant to the specific year. Our data on hand is for the state of New York with over 10,000 records in our sample size.

#### PHYSHLTH responses are in response to a question of how many days in th the last 30 did they have any health concerns.

#### RENTHOM1 responses are in response to question of whether they rent or own their current residence
